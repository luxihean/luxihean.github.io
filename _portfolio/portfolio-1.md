    During my first semester in college, I successfully built an intelligent line-following car. Throughout the entire process, I gained proficiency in modeling and assembling mechanical components, understanding microcontroller principles, working with timer interrupts and button interrupts, electronic soldering, knowledge of analog-to-digital conversion, programming in C language, PCB design, component procurement, and software debugging.
