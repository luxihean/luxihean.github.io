This is a series of blog tutorials that will guide you on properly installing IC617 and Calibre on Ubuntu, how to add process libraries, simulate basic circuits like NMOS and inverters, and how to use Cadence for schematic capture, circuit layout, and PCB design. I hope this can help you! visit my [Github Page]https://github.com/luxihean/Cadence to get more information.
